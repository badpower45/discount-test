عنوان الطلب: (Urgent Final Escalation) - Project Unusable Due to Persistent Replit Environment Conflict with Vite

نص الرسالة:

To the Replit Support Team,

I am writing to you for a final time regarding my project, which has been completely unusable for an extended period due to a persistent environmental issue on your platform. We have exhausted all standard debugging procedures, and the problem is clearly not with my application code but with the Replit environment itself.

The Core Problem:

My Vite + React application fails to load in the Replit webview, consistently showing a white/black screen. We have identified the root cause: a critical JavaScript error caused by scripts injected by the Replit environment.

The specific error is: Uncaught Error: A custom element with name 'mce-autosize-textarea' has already been defined.

The stack trace for this error clearly indicates it originates from overlay_bundle.js, a script that Replit injects into the webview. This script is conflicting with the Vite development server and its dependencies, causing the entire application to crash before it can render.

What We Have Already Done (Multiple Times):

We have meticulously followed every best practice and debugging step to resolve this, including:

Correcting vite.config.ts: The configuration has been set to the standard, recommended settings for Replit, including host: '0.0.0.0' and the correct HMR proxy settings (clientPort: 443, protocol: 'wss').

Simplifying .replit: The configuration file has been simplified to the most basic run = "npm run dev" command to eliminate any workflow conflicts.

Fixing All Application Code: We have fixed all bugs in the application code itself, including data fetching, component logic, and database functions. The application code is production-ready.

Despite all these fixes, the Replit-injected script continues to break the application.

Required Action - The Final Solution:

This is no longer a debugging request; this is an escalation. I need a Replit engineer to investigate the environment for my Repl and provide a definitive solution. The solution must be one of the following:

Provide a working environment configuration: Provide the exact .replit and vite.config.ts configuration that is guaranteed to work with your platform's script injection and proxy, and stops this conflict.

Disable the conflicting script: As a direct solution, please provide a way to disable the Replit overlay_bundle.js script from being injected into my project's webview. Since this script is the source of the fatal error, disabling it is the most logical step to make my project functional.

I have spent a significant amount of time trying to get a standard Vite application to work on your platform. I need a working solution, not more general advice. Please escalate this issue to an engineer who can resolve this environmental conflict.

Thank you.
