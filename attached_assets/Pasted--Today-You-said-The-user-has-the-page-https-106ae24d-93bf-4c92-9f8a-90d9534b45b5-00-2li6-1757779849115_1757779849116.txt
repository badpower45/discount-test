üîç Error Explanation:

The DevTools console is reporting:

Code


Copy
Uncaught Error: A custom element with name 'mce-autosize-textarea' has already been defined.
This error occurs when the browser tries to register a Custom Element using customElements.define() with a name that has already been registered in the current document context.

In this case, 'mce-autosize-textarea' is the name of a custom element‚Äîlikely part of a rich text editor or UI library‚Äîand it's being defined more than once.

‚ö†Ô∏è What Could Have Caused It:

Duplicate Imports: The script that defines 'mce-autosize-textarea' might be included more than once (e.g., multiple <script> tags loading the same module).

Multiple Bundles: If your app uses micro frontends or loads multiple bundles (like overlay_bundle.js), each might try to define the same element.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR): During development, tools like Vite or Webpack might re-inject scripts, causing redefinition.

Third-party Library Conflict: A third-party library might internally define the same element, and if it's loaded more than once, it triggers this error.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix It:

Here are a few strategies:

Check for Duplicate Script Loads:

Inspect your HTML and bundler config to ensure webcomponents-ce.js or any script defining 'mce-autosize-textarea' is loaded only once.

Guard Against Redefinition:
Add a check before defining the custom element:

js


Copy
if (!customElements.get('mce-autosize-textarea')) {
  customElements.define('mce-autosize-textarea', YourElementClass);
}
Refactor Bundle Logic:

If using multiple bundles, ensure shared components are defined in a single, centralized module.

Review Vite Config (based on your page error):

Your page also shows a blocked host error. Make sure server.allowedHosts in vite.config.js includes your dev host:

js


Copy
server: {
  allowedHosts: ['106ae24d-93bf-4c92-9f8a-90d9534b45b5-00-2li6vi6mid2qj.riker.replit.dev']
}
Let me know if you'd like help tracing where 'mce-autosize-textarea' is being defined or optimizing your bundling setup.

This error message is a classic case of duplicate custom element registration in a web application using Web Components:

‚ö†Ô∏è What the Error Means
Code


Copy
Uncaught Error: A custom element with name 'mce-autosize-textarea' has already been defined.
This tells us that the browser tried to register a custom element named 'mce-autosize-textarea' using customElements.define(...), but that name was already registered earlier in the same page context. Custom element names must be unique and can only be defined once per document.

üîç What Likely Caused It
Here are common culprits:

Duplicate script imports: The module or script that defines 'mce-autosize-textarea' is being loaded more than once‚Äîpossibly via multiple <script> tags or repeated imports in different bundles.

Multiple bundles defining the same component: If you're using a bundler like Vite, Webpack, or Rollup, and have split code across bundles (e.g., overlay_bundle.js), the same component might be defined in more than one bundle.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) during development: HMR can sometimes re-inject modules without properly cleaning up previously registered elements.

Third-party library conflict: A library like TinyMCE or a custom UI toolkit might internally define 'mce-autosize-textarea', and if it's included multiple times, this error will surface.

‚úÖ How to Fix It
Here‚Äôs how you can resolve the issue:

1. Guard Against Redefinition
Before defining the element, check if it's already registered:

js


Copy
if (!customElements.get('mce-autosize-textarea')) {
  customElements.define('mce-autosize-textarea', YourElementClass);
}
2. Audit Your Imports
Make sure the script or module that defines 'mce-autosize-textarea' is only loaded once.

Check your bundler config to avoid duplicating shared components across bundles.

3. Use a Shared Component Registry
If you're working with micro frontends or multiple bundles, centralize the registration of shared components to avoid collisions.

4. Disable HMR for Critical Modules (if needed)
If HMR is causing redefinition during development, consider disabling it for modules that define custom elements.

Let me know if you want help tracing where 'mce-autosize-textarea' is being defined or optimizing your bundling strategy. I can walk you through it.

You're seeing this error because the browser is trying to register a Custom Element named 'mce-autosize-textarea' more than once:

Code


Copy
Uncaught Error: A custom element with name 'mce-autosize-textarea' has already been defined.
üß† What‚Äôs Happening
Custom elements are part of the Web Components standard. Once an element is registered using customElements.define('element-name', classDef), it cannot be redefined. If your code‚Äîor one of your dependencies‚Äîtries to define 'mce-autosize-textarea' again, the browser throws this error.

üîç Likely Causes
Duplicate script imports: The module that defines 'mce-autosize-textarea' might be loaded twice, either directly or through multiple bundles.

Multiple bundles defining the same component: If overlay_bundle.js and another script both define the same element, you‚Äôll hit this error.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) during development: Tools like Vite or Webpack might re-inject modules without cleaning up previous definitions.

Third-party library conflict: Libraries like TinyMCE or similar editors may internally register this element. If the library is loaded more than once, it causes a clash.

‚úÖ How to Fix It
Here‚Äôs how you can resolve or prevent the issue:

1. Guard Against Redefinition
Before defining the element, check if it‚Äôs already registered:

js


Copy
if (!customElements.get('mce-autosize-textarea')) {
  customElements.define('mce-autosize-textarea', YourElementClass);
}
2. Audit Your Imports
Check your HTML and bundler config to ensure the script defining 'mce-autosize-textarea' is only loaded once.

If using Vite, Webpack, or Rollup, inspect your dependency graph to avoid duplication.

3. Centralize Component Registration
