üîç Error Explanation:

The DevTools console is reporting:

Code


Copy
Uncaught Error: A custom element with name 'mce-autosize-textarea' has already been defined.
This error occurs when the browser tries to register a Custom Element using customElements.define() with a name that has already been registered in the current document context.

In this case, 'mce-autosize-textarea' is the name of a custom element‚Äîlikely part of a rich text editor or UI library‚Äîand it's being defined more than once.

‚ö†Ô∏è What Could Have Caused It:

Duplicate Imports: The script that defines 'mce-autosize-textarea' might be included more than once (e.g., multiple <script> tags loading the same module).

Multiple Bundles: If your app uses micro frontends or loads multiple bundles (like overlay_bundle.js), each might try to define the same element.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR): During development, tools like Vite or Webpack might re-inject scripts, causing redefinition.

Third-party Library Conflict: A third-party library might internally define the same element, and if it's loaded more than once, it triggers this error.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix It:

Here are a few strategies:

Check for Duplicate Script Loads:

Inspect your HTML and bundler config to ensure webcomponents-ce.js or any script defining 'mce-autosize-textarea' is loaded only once.

Guard Against Redefinition:
Add a check before defining the custom element:

js


Copy
if (!customElements.get('mce-autosize-textarea')) {
  customElements.define('mce-autosize-textarea', YourElementClass);
}
Refactor Bundle Logic:

If using multiple bundles, ensure shared components are defined in a single, centralized module.

Review Vite Config (based on your page error):

Your page also shows a blocked host error. Make sure server.allowedHosts in vite.config.js includes your dev host:

js


Copy
server: {
  allowedHosts: ['106ae24d-93bf-4c92-9f8a-90d9534b45b5-00-2li6vi6mid2qj.riker.replit.dev']
}
Let me know if you'd like help tracing where 'mce-autosize-textarea' is being defined or optimizing your bundling setup.
