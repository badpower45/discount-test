You are now working on my project which is a **Discount Platform Web App** similar to “Waffarha”.  
I already designed the frontend UI in Figma and converted it to React code. The backend/database and authentication are handled by **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Auth + API).  
I want you to make this project fully working on Replit.

Here is what you need to do and understand:

1. **Project Description**  
   - This is a discount platform where users can browse offers (restaurants, cafes, etc.), register their info, and receive a unique discount code.  
   - Restaurants can log in to their dashboard to validate discount codes and mark them as used.  
   - Admin can see all customers, coupons, restaurants, and statistics.  
   - The system must connect to Supabase for storing users, offers, and coupons.

2. **Tech Stack**  
   - Frontend: React (with TailwindCSS for styling).  
   - Backend: Supabase (Auth, Database, API).  
   - Hosting: Currently on Replit for development. Later we may deploy frontend to Netlify and keep Supabase as backend.  

3. **Tasks for you on Replit**  
   - Setup a working React environment.  
   - Install all dependencies (React, TailwindCSS, Supabase JS client, React Router if needed).  
   - Create `.env` file for Supabase credentials (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY).  
   - Make sure the app connects to Supabase and can perform CRUD operations (create coupon, read offers, update coupon status, etc.).  
   - Provide working scripts:  
     - `npm run dev` → start development server.  
     - `npm run build` → build production version.  
     - `npm start` → run production build.  

4. **Expected Features to be Working**  
   - User can browse offers on homepage.  
   - User can register to get a discount code (saved in Supabase).  
   - Discount code is shown on screen and linked to that user in DB.  
   - Restaurant dashboard can validate and mark codes as used.  
   - Admin dashboard can view stats and data from Supabase.  

5. **Your Goal**  
   - Make sure the project runs smoothly on Replit.  
   - Fix any missing connections between React frontend and Supabase backend.  
   - Ensure that the app is functional for demo (MVP).  
   - Prepare it so later I can deploy frontend on Netlify easily.

Please confirm setup, run the app, and give me back a working version on Replit.
